<h3 class="dateStamp">Monday, 16th January 2017</h3>
<p class="myNote">This blog was first published as a Linkedin article (see <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/modelling-dike-breaching-using-telemac-2d-december-2013-maskell?trk=prof-post"> here</a>) but is replished here.</p2>
<p class="p1">On December 5th-6th 2013 Cyclone Xaver generated storm surge levels along the coastal regions of the southern North Sea that were the highest on record at some tide gauge locations on the UK East Coast exceeding those of the disastrous 1953 event. However, this time the UK was better protected by coastal defences and flood warnings gave people more time to be prepared. At the time I was working at Risk Management Solutions and we went to visit some of the sites affected by the surge to survey the damage. We found that the defences had generally performed well and had prevented more serious flooding (more info <a href="http://forms2.rms.com/rs/729-DJX-565/images/ws_2013_2014_europe_winter_storms.pdfhere). However, it was apparent that in some cases the current defences had only just prevented serious flooding for an event of this magnitude or were breached causing flooding."> here</a>) However, it was apparent that in some cases the current defences had only just prevented serious flooding for an event of this magnitude or were breached causing flooding.</p>
