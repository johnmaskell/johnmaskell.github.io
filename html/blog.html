<h1 id="blog-1">Modelling dike breaching using TELEMAC-2D - A December 2013 case study</h1>
<h3 class="dateStamp">Monday, 16th January 2017</h3>
<p class="myNote">This blog was first published as a Linkedin article (see <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/modelling-dike-breaching-using-telemac-2d-december-2013-maskell?trk=prof-post"> here</a>) but is replished here.</p2>
<p class="p1">On December 5th-6th 2013 Cyclone Xaver generated storm surge levels along the coastal regions of the southern North Sea that were the highest on record at some tide gauge locations on the UK East Coast exceeding those of the disastrous 1953 event. However, this time the UK was better protected by coastal defences and flood warnings gave people more time to be prepared. At the time I was working at Risk Management Solutions and we went to visit some of the sites affected by the surge to survey the damage. We found that the defences had generally performed well and had prevented more serious flooding (more info <a href="http://forms2.rms.com/rs/729-DJX-565/images/ws_2013_2014_europe_winter_storms.pdfhere). However, it was apparent that in some cases the current defences had only just prevented serious flooding for an event of this magnitude or were breached causing flooding."> here</a>) However, it was apparent that in some cases the current defences had only just prevented serious flooding for an event of this magnitude or were breached causing flooding.</p>

<p class="p2"> In Boston, Lincolnshire, the River Haven burst its banks as the storm surge propagated up the estuary flooding many homes and businesses and the historic church. Just outside Boston dike failure led to the inundation of a waste recycling plant, a number of warehouses and business units and the surrounding crop fields. The site and approximate breach location (shown in red) can be seen in the image below.</p>

<p class="p2">Predicting breaches such as this one is hard to do as they often occur due to very specific local water levels and/or wave conditions and differences in the dike level or structural integrity. However, it may be useful to model breaching scenarios at various locations to investigate the potential impact and make more informed decisions on allocating resources to defence construction and maintenance.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://www.opentelemac.org/index.php/presentation?id=17">TELEMAC-2D</a> allows you to simulate dike breaching for a range of scenarios and breach growth mechanisms. Data such as the <a href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/spatial-flood-defences-including-standardised-attributes">Spatial Flood Defences</a> dataset and <a href="http://environment.data.gov.uk/ds/survey/index.jsp#/survey">LIDAR digital surface models</a> at 1 m resolution are now publicly available and allow you to identify defence assets that could be liable to breaching and resolve features such as dikes in hydrodynamic simulations.</p>

<p class="p2">To simulate the dike breach at the recycling plant near Boston in December 2013 a mesh was created in <a href="http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/solutions/advisory/blue_kenue_index.html">Blue Kenue</a> using publicly available data. The mesh extends offshore from the study site to simulate the surge propagation into the region resolving the River Haven and region of inundation at increased resolution.</p>	
<p class="p2">The 1 m LIDAR data and high density of mesh elements allows the dike to be well resolved and can be seen in light blue in the image below.</p>
<img class="img-displayed" src="https://bricaq.bn1304.livefilestore.com/y3mJ_ebc7RHg2yxSn4NCvqtU9HYibjca9TqYL9-QWb2W1IohvnZveSTQFZB2XUkvrDWVqzkGkCBS-3fp6WD7XohizyI2WifLrJuAbYPa6WD830jJj6EPJPr8O-armpaLhAJ5gUzRhGn9ngucoXfldOBHCtZDCEpChJvb51xkJFdevE?width=1699&height=922&cropmode=none"/>
<p class="p2">This event can be accurately simulated based on knowledge of the breach location and the approximate region of inundation and visualized in 3D using Blue Kenue (see below). The method can be extended to simulate other such historic events or breach scenarios and is a useful tool for investigating the impacts of dike breaching. However, simulating multiple events/breach scenarios is computationally expensive due to the small time-step and element size needed to resolve dikes in the hydrodynamic simulation but could be partially resolved through the use of CPU clusters and parallel processing.</p>
